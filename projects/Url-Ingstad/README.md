### Description
url-ingstad is a a play on "earl ingstad" from the vikings tv show - which was a name lagertha the female hero of the series took to be anonymous when surprising her ex-husband at a meeting.  So, anything vikingish and bookmark/linkish?  Just simple and contemporary.  Is all that possible? :)  shrugs...

### Time Constraints
totally flexible - thank you sir!
