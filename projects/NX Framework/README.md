## [NX Framework](https://github.com/g-harel/open-source-logos/issues/1)

> Project org (many repos): https://github.com/nx-js
   Main repo: https://github.com/nx-js/framework
   Home page: https://nx-framework.com/

### Background

NX is a next-gen front-end framework. It consists of small Web Components based core and a lot of focused feature modules tied together with a middleware system. The feature modules are written to be usable by other frameworks as well. As an example I just released a [React port](https://github.com/solkimicreb/react-easy-state) for my observable / state management module.

### Description

I would like to keep the green/white colors from the home page, but it could be bolder with some contrast too. The flagship feature is modularity so something that outlines that would be great. It is also real DOM based framework (no VDOM) with more focus on implementing old battle tested ideas right, so maybe some nostalgic tone could be used too (for example inspiration from the HTML logo).

### Time Constraints

No real constraints. As the project uses (unshimmable) Proxies it is really a next-gen framework, it won't be production ready for a while (I aim to release v1 in the fall). I was kind of silently working on the next major beta version, which will be ready in a few weeks. A logo would be awesome with that, but no need to rush it.
