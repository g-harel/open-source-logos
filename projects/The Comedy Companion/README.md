## The Comedy Companion
> https://github.com/dereksweet/ComedyCompanion

### Background
React Native application for comedians to manage their jokes, set lists, and shows.

### Description
I would love a little character like the Reddit alien to go with the project. Something rather simple with black and white for the most part with tiny splashes of colour. I was envisioning a little devil, as opposed to an alien, with a big microphone nearly the size of his body in front of him.

### Time Constraints
No time constraints at all. Would like to release the app soon but am in no real rush to do so. The whole app is pretty much finished, just need to add a splash page, logo, and app icon. If you are able to just draw the character I can probably do the rest as I'm quite proficient with fonts and such, just a terrible artist. If you do actually want to make me a complete logo that could be used for the splash page the full app name is "The Comedy Companion".
